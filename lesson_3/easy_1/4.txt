numbers.delete_at(1) # numbers is now [1, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.delete(1) # numbers is now [2, 3, 4, 5]

Another thing to notice is that while both of these methods 
operate on the contents of the referenced array and modify it in 
place (rather than just returning a modified version of the array) 
these methods do NOT have the usual ! at the end of the method name for 
"modify in place" method names.
