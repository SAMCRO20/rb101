# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method change_me which returns the same
# string but with all the words in it that are palindromes uppercased.

# change_me("We will meet at noon") == "We will meet at NOON"
# change_me("No palindromes here") == "No palindromes here"
# change_me("") == ""
# change_me("I LOVE my mom and dad equally") == "I LOVE my MOM and DAD equally"

# input: string
# output: string (not the same object)
# rules:
#      Explicit requirements:
#        - every palindrome in the string must be converted to
#          uppercase. (Reminder: a palindrome is a word that reads
#          the same forwards and backward).
#        - Palindromes are case sensitive ("Dad" is not a palindrome, but "dad" is.)

#      Implicit requirements:
#        - the returned string shouldn't be the same string object.
#        - if the string is an empty string, the result should be an empty
#          string

# PROBLEM:

# Given a string, write a method `palindrome_substrings` which returns
# all the substrings from a given string which are palindromes. Consider
# palindrome words case sensitive.

# Test cases:

# palindrome_substrings("supercalifragilisticexpialidocious") == ["ili"]
# palindrome_substrings("abcddcbA") == ["bcddcb", "cddc", "dd"]
# palindrome_substrings("palindrome") == []
# palindrome_substrings("") == []

# Some questions you might have?
# 1. What is a substring?
# 2. What is a palindrome?
# 3. Will inputs always be strings?
# 4. What does it mean to treat palindrome words case-sensitively?

# input: string
# output: an array of substrings
# rules:
#      Explicit requirements:
#        - return only substrings which are palindromes.
#        - palindrome words should be case sensitive, meaning "abBA"
#          is not a palindrome.

# Algorithm:
#  - initialize a result variable to an empty array
#  - create an array named substring_arr that contains all of the
#    substrings of the input string that are at least 2 characters long.
#  - loop through the words in the substring_arr array.
#  - if the word is a palindrome, append it to the result
#    array
#  - return the result array
